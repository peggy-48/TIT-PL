# TIT-PL
TIT stands for Tacx Interpretor Tool, Tacx being a new language, the comments have no space and are started by @ symbol, define defines a variable, and everything finishes with a comma! (Even the comments)
# Problems
But sometimes TIT has a bit of a pain in the ass to actually identify where is a comma, so TIT does a warning and passes it!
# About more info
TIT is in beta: Tacx is a new interpreted language (a hybrid between C and simplicity this time) so its a pain in the ass to build your parser with generic Python and no AST
| Python Speed  | TIT's speeed! |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| 000000000.45  | 000000000.54  |
| 000000000.01  | 000000000.02  |

As there is zero buffer, TIT is really less faster than Python!
If someone could give me a solution to reach at least 000000000.30 or faster, i'd make an GitHub organization for TIT
